### What I learned
This was my first project using Vue and an API. I learned a lot during this project. It has helped me solidify my understanding of how Vue works.

### Continued development

I plan on adding a 'Schedule' nav that will show current air time schedules.

I look forward to creating more applications using APIs. I would also like to build a larger project using Vue to continue my development with that framework.
